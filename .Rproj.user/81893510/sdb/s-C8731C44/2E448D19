The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.\n```{r}\n\nmean(na.omit(data$steps)) #just use the mean value of steps\n\nlength(data[!mask,]$steps) #as you can see we can isolate and replace the missing values, as the length of this subset matches the number of missing values\n\n```\n\n#### 3 - Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.\n```{r}\n#Replace missing steps values with interval means\ndataPatched <- data #copy the data\ndataPatched[!mask,]$steps <- mean(na.omit(data$steps)) #replace missing values with the mean steps\n\n```\n\n#### 4 - Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?\n\n```{r}\n\nplotme3 = aggregate(steps ~ date, data=dataPatched, FUN=sum) #get total steps by day\nggplot(plotme3, aes(x=steps)) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth=2000, colour=\"black\", fill=\"white\") #plot it baby woo\n\nsummary(plotme3$steps) #New, patched data:\n\nsummary(plotme1$Total_Steps) #Unpatched data:\n\n```\n\n## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?\n\n#### 1 - Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.\n```{r}\n\ndataWeekTest <- dataPatched #use the dataset with filled in values\n\ndataWeekTest$day <- factor(weekdays(dataWeekTest$date)) #make a day of the week factor, listing all days\n#but we want a 2 level factor for Weekend and Weekday, so:\nlevels(dataWeekTest$day) <- c(\"weekday\",\"weekday\",\"weekend\",\"weekend\",\"weekday\",\"weekday\",\"weekday\") #duplicate levels down to weekend and weekday\n\n```\n\n#### 2 - Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = \"l\") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.\n```{r}\n#aggregate it!\nplotme4_weekend <- plotme4 <- aggregate(dataWeekTest$steps[dataWeekTest$day==\"weekend\"], list(dataWeekTest[,\"interval\"][dataWeekTest$day==\"weekend\"]), \"mean\") \nplotme4_weekday <- plotme4 <- aggregate(dataWeekTest$steps[dataWeekTest$day==\"weekday\"], list(dataWeekTest[,\"interval\"][dataWeekTest$day==\"weekday\"]), \"mean\")\n\n#make a panel plot\nlibrary(\"lattice\")\n\ncolnames(plotme4_weekend) <- c(\"interval\", \"steps\")\ncolnames(plotme4_weekday) <- c(\"interval\", \"steps\")\n\nplotme4_weekday$dayType <- \"weekday\" #add designators\nplotme4_weekend$dayType <- \"weekend\"\n\nplotme4 <- rbind(plotme4_weekday, plotme4_weekend)\n\nxyplot(\n    type=\"l\",\n    data=plotme4,\n    steps ~ interval | dayType,\n    xlab=\"Interval\",\n    ylab=\"Num steps\",\n    layout=c(1,2)\n)\n\n```\n\n",
